It is the initial task from CodeGames website. This code determins the closer enemy and prints it's name to the console using ternary operator.

```JavaScript
while (true) {
    var enemy1 = readline(); 
    var dist1 = parseInt(readline()); 
    var enemy2 = readline(); 
    var dist2 = parseInt(readline()); 

    function printEnemy1() {
        console.log(enemy1)
    }

    function printEnemy2() {
        console.log(enemy2)
    }

    dist1 < dist2 ? printEnemy1() : printEnemy2()
}
```
